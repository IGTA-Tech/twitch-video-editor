- **Mac**: `brew install ffmpeg`
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### App Won't Start
```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.10+)
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try running directly
python main.py
```

### Processing Errors
- Make sure the video file isn't corrupted
- Try with a shorter test video first
- Check that you have enough disk space

## Tips & Tricks

### For Best Results
1. **Start with FFmpeg Only mode** for speed
2. **Use "Safe Cut" preset** to avoid cutting too much
3. **Enable Timestamp Report** to see what was removed
4. **Process overnight** for large batches

### Customizing Settings
- **Silence Threshold**: Lower = removes more (try -25dB to -35dB)
- **Min Duration**: Higher = removes less (try 2-5 seconds)
- **Padding**: Keep 0.5-1s before/after speech for natural flow

### Batch Processing Multiple Streams
1. Add all files to queue at once
2. Configure settings once
3. Click "Process All"
